Description: Understanding how features influence a specific response variable becomes crucial in classification problems, with applications ranging from medical diagnosis to customer behavior analysis. 
			 This packages provides tools to compute such an influence measure grounded on game theory concepts.
			 In particular, the influence measures presented in Davila-Pena, Saavedra-Nieves, and Casas-MÃ©ndez (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2408.02481> can be obtained.

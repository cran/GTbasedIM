\title{Cars Binary Dataset}
\format{
A dataframe with 17565 rows (representing individuals) and 12 columns, one corresponding to the index number
(first column, \code{X}), one to the binary response (last column, \code{deceased}), and the remaining 10 representing the following binary features:

\describe{
\item{\code{dvcat}}{Binary variable indicating whether the vehicle, at the moment of the accident, was traveling at a speed higher than 55 km/h (1) or not (0).}
\item{\code{airbag}}{Binary variable indicating whether the vehicle had an airbag system (1) or not (0).}
\item{\code{seatbelt}}{Binary variable indicating whether the person involved was wearing a seat belt (1) or not (0).}
\item{\code{frontal}}{Binary variable indicating whether the vehicle crash was frontal (1) or nonfrontal (0).}
\item{\code{sex}}{Binary variable indicating the sex of the person involved: 1 for male and 0 for female.}
\item{\code{abcat}}{Binary variable indicating airbag activation: 1 if one or more airbags in the vehicle were activated (even if not deployed) and 0 if none were deployed (either due to malfunction or being disabled).}
\item{\code{occRole}}{Binary variable indicating whether the person involved was the driver (1) or a passenger (0) of the vehicle.}
\item{\code{deploy}}{Binary variable indicating whether the airbag functioned correctly (1) or was unavailable or not functioning (0).}
\item{\code{ageOFocc}}{Binary variable indicating whether the person was 30 years old or less (1) or over 30 years old (0).}
\item{\code{age}}{Binary variable indicating whether the vehicle was 10 years old or more (1) or less than 10 years old (0).}

\description{
This dataset contains data on car crash fatalities after transforming the original
categorical variables of the dataset \code{cars_original} into binary variables. Details
about such transformations are available in Davila-Pena et al. (2024).
(Section 6.1, Table 5).
